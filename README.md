The scripts are code supporting the research "Ignoring Plant Physiological Responses to Elevated CO2 Will Overestimate Terrestrial Vertebrate Biodiversity Loss Under Global Climate Change".
The repository inclues main code for data analysis (Step1_data_process.py,Step2_predictors_generation.py,Step3_model_training.py) and figures plotting (Figure_oct.py).
